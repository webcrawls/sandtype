## Roadmap

> Typing with Terry is in a _very_ rough beta, as this is my first time writing proper C# in this kind of game engine. Please excuse any mistakes (more than open to suggestions)!

- **Typing game**
    - Defend against enemies with each word typed
    - Certain words may deliver health/buffs
- **Multiplayer support**
    - support loading into any map with multiple players
    - nameplate to show stats above each player
    - save/load each player's stats (s&box stats service?)
- **In-world interactions**
    > I think s&box shines when games take place in the 3D world, so I don't want the game to only be 2D
    - NPC system (dialog, test giver, etc)
    - Physical keyboard/computer to sit at
